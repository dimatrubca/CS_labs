## Lab 7: Database Security
 

## Tasks
- Create a MongoDB database which would contain some secured sensitive data (protected
via 2-way encryption);
- Create an application which would display the data contained in the database (both
common data and the decrypted sensitive data);
- Make sure that the sensitive data can only be accessed via your application (i.e. it is
secure).


### Usage:
- Create virtual enviroment ```python3 -m venv venv```
- Activate virtual enviroment: ```python3 venv/scripts/activate``` (```source/bin/active for Linux```)
- Install requirements: ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
- Launch main program: ```python3 lab3/main.py```
